/**
 * Syncs gravity and gyroscope sensor measurements in case they arrive with certain delay.

 *
 * @property context Android context.
 * @property gyroscopeSensorType One of the supported gyroscope sensor types.
 * @property gravitySensorDelay Delay of gravity sensor between samples.
 * @property gyroscopeSensorDelay Delay of gyroscope sensor between samples.
 * @property gravityCapacity capacity of gravity buffer.
 * @property gyroscopeCapacity capacity of gyroscope buffer.
 * @property staleOffsetNanos offset respect most recent received timestamp of a measurement to
 * consider the measurement as stale so that it is skipped from synced measurement processing and
 * returned back from buffer to cache of measurements.
 * @property staleDetectionEnabled true to enable stale measurement detection, false otherwise.
 * @property gravityStartOffsetEnabled indicates whether gravity start offset will be
 * computed when first measurement is received. True indicates that offset is computed, false
 * assumes that offset is null.
 * @property gyroscopeStartOffsetEnabled indicates whether gyroscope start offset will be computed
 * when first measurement is received. True indicates that offset is computed, false assumes that
 * offset is null.
 * @property stopWhenFilledBuffer true to stop syncer when any buffer completely fills, false to
 * continue processing measurements at the expense of loosing old data. This will be notified using
 * [bufferFilledListener].
 * @property staleOffsetNanos offset respect most recent received timestamp of a measurement to

 * generated.
 * @property syncedMeasurementListener listener to notify the generation of a new synced
 * measurement.
