/**
 * Estimates the accumulated mean values of a triad of measurements.
 * This estimator takes a given number of measurement triads (acceleration, angular speed,
 * magnetic field, etc) during a given duration of time to estimate measurement averages, standard
 * deviations, variances, as well as average time interval between measurements.
 * For best accuracy of estimated results, device should remain static while data is being
 * collected.
 * This estimator converts sensor measurements from device ENU coordinates to local plane NED
 * coordinates. Thus, all values referring to a given x-y-z coordinates refers to local plane
 * NED system of coordinates.
 *
 * @property context Android context.
 * @property sensorDelay Delay of sensor between samples.
 * @param maxSamples Maximum number of samples to take into account before completion. This is
 * only taken into account if using either [StopMode.MAX_SAMPLES_ONLY] or
 * [StopMode.MAX_SAMPLES_OR_DURATION].
 * @param maxDurationMillis Maximum duration expressed in milliseconds to take into account
 * before completion. This is only taken into account if using either
 * [StopMode.MAX_DURATION_ONLY] or [StopMode.MAX_SAMPLES_OR_DURATION].
 * @param stopMode Determines when this estimator will consider its estimation completed.
 * @property completedListener Listener to notify when estimation is complete.
 * @property unreliableListener Listener to notify when sensor becomes unreliable, and thus,
 * estimation must be discarded.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException when either [maxSamples] or [maxDurationMillis] is negative.
