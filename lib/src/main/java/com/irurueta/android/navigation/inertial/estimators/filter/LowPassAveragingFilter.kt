/**
 * First order IIR averaging filter.
 * IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filters of first order follow expressions like the one below:
 * output = a * input + b * prevOutput, where a = 1.0-b,
 * where:
 * b = e^-2*π*fc -> ln(b) = -2*π*fc -> fc = -ln(b) / (2*π) and fc is the cutoff frequency.
 * For typical default values:
 * dt = 0.02 (50 Hz) s, and timeConstant = 0.1, dt is the time interval between samples,
 * b = timeConstant / (timeConstant + dt) = 0.1 / (0.1 + 0.02)
 * b = 0.8333
 * Consequently fc = -ln(0.8333) / (2*π) = 0.02 Hz
